All little projects and exercises of my studies for my master's degree at the University of Ulm are in this repository. 

I won't add a special license to all projects or even files. You should feel free to use parts of my code, if there are no other information about licensing. But please use my code only in conjunction with my name. Thanks.

Happy Hacking!
