All little projects and exercises of my studies for my master's degree at the University of Ulm are in this repository. 

If there are no other information about licensing, all projects and files are under THE BEER-WARE LICENSE (Revision 42). You should feel free to use parts of my code, but only in conjunction with my name and a beer if we meet each other. Thanks.

Happy Hacking!
